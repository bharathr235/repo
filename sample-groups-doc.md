The Room Blocks screen has been revamped with new features.

The improved functionality mainly pertains to the Setup tab, with several improvements intended to improve the user experience.

The first change you will notice is that the Setup and Status tabs are consolidated into a single view. Everything you need to know about the room blocks will now be available on one screen.

Added a new fourth paragraph.
